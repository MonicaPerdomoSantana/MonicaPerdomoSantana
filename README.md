## 👋 About Me

I’m Mónica, a Junior QA Tester passionate about ensuring high-quality digital experiences. After several years working in translation and interpreting, I’ve pivoted into tech, bringing with me strong communication skills, attention to detail, and an analytical mindset. Currently, I’m gaining hands-on experience through real-world QA projects while studying for my ISTQB certification.

I enjoy combining manual and automated testing practices with tools like Playwright, Postman, and GitHub Actions to build robust and efficient test workflows.
